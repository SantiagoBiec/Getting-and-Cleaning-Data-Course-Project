# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project


There is just one script called `run_analysis.R`. 

To use it first you need to download the file "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip" and unzip it.

Then you can run the code `run_analysis.R.`

It will collect the data from the folders and create a Assignment4.txt with the final table asked in the project.
